	    #       (e.g. construct an execution tree using a set of lists and dicts).
	    #    2. Look for browser processes with subprocesses that are not browser-related subprocesses.
	    #       NOTE: to simplify the logic, if the commandline string matches browserSubProcRegex, it can be considered to be browser-related.

        #          ```

        # Hint #3: Check the fields you need to populate by inspecting the spb.BrowserSubProc protobuf message.
